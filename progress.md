# Pyst Development Progress

## Current Status: Phase 2 Complete! ðŸš€

**Just finished:** Phase 2 "The Ergonomic Experience" - fully implemented and tested.

## Phase 2 Accomplishments (All âœ…)

### Core Infrastructure
- **JSON introspection schema v1.0.0** - Comprehensive, versioned metadata format
- **Cascading config system** - XDG directories, env vars, project-local `.pyst.toml`
- **Hash-based caching** - SHA256 content + dependency + Python version validation
- **Dual-mode introspection** - Safe (AST) vs Import (dynamic) with trust system

### User Experience Features
- **Enhanced commands**: `list`, `info`, `explain`, `cache`, `trust`
- **Context system**: Rule-based script filtering with glob patterns (`!db-*`)
- **Smart output**: Descriptions from docstrings, dependency info, CLI framework detection
- **Security**: Trust system for privileged introspection, `--force` flag for bypassing contexts

### Python Helper
- **`introspector.py`** - Full AST parser with PEP 723, framework detection, dependency analysis
- **Sandboxed execution** - Via `uv run` subprocess, no PyO3 dependencies

## What's Working Right Now

```bash
# Enhanced listing with descriptions
pyst list                    # Shows enabled scripts with descriptions
pyst list --all             # Shows all including disabled ones

# Rich script information  
pyst info hello             # Shows dependencies, functions, trust status, etc.

# Context rule explanation
pyst explain db-backup      # Shows why scripts are enabled/disabled

# Trust and caching
pyst trust .pyst/hello.py   # Mark script as trusted for import-mode
pyst cache path             # Show cache location
pyst cache clear            # Clear introspection cache

# Force execution
pyst run --force db-backup  # Bypass context rules when needed
```

## Next Up: Phase 3 "The Sharing Ecosystem"

### Plan for Phase 3 Implementation
1. **URL parsing & source detection** - GitHub repos, gists, raw URLs
2. **Download & validation** - Clone/fetch with commit pinning 
3. **Installation manifest** - Track installed scripts with metadata
4. **PATH shim creation** - Make scripts globally accessible
5. **Update/uninstall system** - Manage installed script lifecycle

### Commands to Implement
- `pyst install <URL> [--as <name>]` - Install from GitHub/gist/raw URL
- `pyst uninstall <script>` - Remove installed script
- `pyst update <script>` - Update to latest version
- Enhanced `list` to show install source info

### Test Cases Needed
**Waiting for user to provide:**
- Test GitHub repo with multiple Python scripts
- Test Gist with a single script (ideally with PEP 723)
- Test raw URL to a .py file

**Can proceed with mock data if needed**

### Implementation Strategy
1. Start with `install/mod.rs` - URL parsing and source detection
2. Build download/clone logic with `git2` or shell commands
3. Create installation manifest system
4. Implement shim creation for PATH integration
5. Add update/uninstall capabilities
6. Enhance existing commands to show install info

### Architecture Notes
- Installation location: `~/.local/share/pyst/scripts/` (already configured)
- Manifest file: `~/.local/share/pyst/manifest.json`
- Commit pinning for reproducible installs
- SHA256 integrity checks
- Dependency isolation via script-specific environments

### Code Status
- All Phase 1 & 2 code compiles and works
- Comprehensive test coverage for core functionality
- Clean workspace structure ready for Phase 3
- Configuration system supports global script dirs

## Questions for Next Session
1. Should I wait for test repos/gists or proceed with mock data?
2. Any specific installation features you want prioritized?
3. Preference for git integration approach (git2 crate vs shell commands)?
